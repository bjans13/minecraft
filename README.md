Minecraft Bedrock Server scripts I use to make updating easier, not perfect but works well enough for me currently.

I don't use these as my primary backups, set to keep only last 30 days.


NOTE: Currently get emails on new version update, then have to run update.sh. Have considered making the updatecheck.sh trigger update.sh to auto apply a newly detected update.

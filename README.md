# minecraft
Scripts I use to make updating easier on my Ubuntu Linux Minecraft Bedrock Server.

I don't use these as my primary backups, set to keep last 30 days.


NOTE: Setup requires running the update srcipt after recieving a notification. I use a bot running in discord where role specific users can tell it to run the update.
